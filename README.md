# ATM-using-Java
- A simple ATM created using Java OOP concepts, data structures, and Swing.
- All source files are stored within a package called "_new". (I previously did one without GUI and it was named "_old")
- Ensure the paths for the text files (accounts.txt, transactions.txt, and history-logs.txt) are correct before running the program.
- All icon images were downloaded from Flaticon: https://www.flaticon.com/
